                Consider:
                    - Common movie knowledge (famous actors, popular films)
                    - Genre conventions (horror = scary, animation = cartoon)
                    - Keep it concise (under 10 words)
                    - It should be a google style search query that's very specific
                    - Don't use boolean logic
                    - one line is enough, no need of reasoning 

                Examples:

                    - "that bear movie where leo gets attacked" -> "The Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio bear attack"
                    - "movie about bear in london with marmalade" -> "Paddington London marmalade"
                    -  "scary movie with bear from few years ago" -> "bear horror movie 2015-2020"
